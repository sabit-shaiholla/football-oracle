## Architecture

1. User Interaction
* Users interact with the Front-End application.
* Users can search for players, view reports, and add reviews
2. Front-End Application
* The React app sends requests to the Back-End using RESTful APIs.
* It handles routing, state management, and UI rendering. 
3. Back-End Application
* The Spring Boot application processes requests from the Front-End.
* It handles business logic, data validation, and communication with the database.
* Controllers manage endpoints for user authentication, player data retrieval, and reviews.
* Services contain the business logic.
* Repositories interact with the PostgreSQL database.
4. Data Fetching Logic
* Database Check: The Back-End checks the PostgreSQL database for player data.
* Fetch from WebPage: If data is not present, it fetches data from the WebPage (FBREF.com).
* Fetch from Gemini Pro API: After getting data from the WebPage, it requests player reports via external API. 
* Save to Database: The fetched data and reports are saved in the database for future queries.
5. External API Interaction
* The Back-End interacts with Gemini Pro API to fetch and process player data when not found in the database.

## Technology Stack

* Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Back-End: Spring Boot (Java)
* Database: PostgreSQL
* External API: Gemini Pro API (Google)
