## Architecture

1. User Interaction
* Users interact with the Front-End application.
* Users can search for players, view reports, and add reviews
2. Front-End Application
* The React app sends requests to the Back-End using RESTful APIs.
* It handles routing, state management, and UI rendering. 
3. Back-End Application
* The Spring Boot application processes requests from the Front-End.
* It handles business logic, data validation, and communication with the database.
* Controllers manage endpoints for user authentication, player data retrieval, and reviews.
* Services contain the business logic.
* Repositories interact with the PostgreSQL database.
4. Data Fetching Logic
* Database Check: The Back-End checks the PostgreSQL database for player data.
* Fetch from WebPage: If data is not present, it fetches data from the WebPage (FBREF.com).
* Fetch from Gemini Pro API: After getting data from the WebPage, it requests player analytics reports via external API. 
* Save to Database: The fetched data and reports are saved in the database for future queries.
5. External API Interaction
* The Back-End interacts with Gemini Pro API to fetch and process player data when not found in the database.

## Technology Stack

* Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Back-End: Spring Boot (Java)
* Database: PostgreSQL
* External API: Gemini Pro API (Google)

## Installation

### Pre-requisites
* Java 17: Ensure you have JDK 17 installed.
* Maven: Ensure you have Maven installed.
* Docker: Ensure you have Docker installed.

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sabit-shaiholla/football-oracle.git
cd football-oracle
```
2. Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory with the necessary environment variables.
```
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret (at least 256 bits)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id (Google Cloud Project ID)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION=your_region (Google Cloud Region)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=your_postgres_url (PostgreSQL URL)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=your_postgres_username (PostgreSQL Username)
SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password (PostgreSQL Password)
SONAR_TOKEN=your_sonar_token (SonarQube token)
```
3. Start PostgreSQL and SonarQube:
Use Docker Compose to start the PostgreSQL and SonarQube services:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
4. Build and run the back-end application:
Use Maven to build and run the application:
```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```
This command will start the PostgreSQL database and SonarQube services in detached mode.
5. Navigate to the front-end directory:
```
cd frontend/football-oracle-fe
```
6. Install npm dependencies:
Use npm to install the necessary dependencies for the front-end:
```
npm install
```
7. Run the front-end application:
Start the front-end application using the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
8. Run SonarQube:
Ensure SonarQube is running and then execute:
```
mvn sonar:sonar -Dsonar.token=SONAR_TOKEN
```
6. Access the Application and SonarQube:
* Back-end Application: The application should be running at http://localhost:8080.
* Front-end Application: The front-end should be running at http://localhost:3000.
* SonarQube: The SonarQube dashboard can be accessed at http://localhost:9000 with the default credentials (you will be asked to update the default password):
  * Username: admin
  * Password: admin
